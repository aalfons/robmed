Changes in robmed version 0.3.0

    + Added method based on median regressions (Yuan & MacKinnon, 2014).


Changes in robmed version 0.2.0

    + Added shiny app for comparing bootstrap methods on simulated data with
      outliers.

    + Added support for multiple mediators for standard and robust bootstrap
      tests based on regressions.

    + Redesigned functions to live in the tidyverse: using under_scores instead
      of camelCase; first argument of fit_mediation() and test_mediation() is a
      data frame.

    + Added method based on robust regressions and fast and robust bootstrap,
      which is the new default method.

    + Wrapper function indirect() now always uses the bootstrap test



Changes in robmed version 0.1.1

    + Bugfix in density plot: bootstrap replicates for indirect effect are now
      correctly extracted.
