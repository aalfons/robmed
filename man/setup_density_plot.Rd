\usage{
setup_density_plot(object, ...)

\method{setup_density_plot}{boot_test_mediation}(object, ...)

\method{setup_density_plot}{sobel_test_mediation}(object, grid = NULL, level = 0.95, ...)

\method{setup_density_plot}{list}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} containing results from
(robust) mediation analysis, or a list of such objects.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.}

\item{grid}{an optional numeric vector containing the values at which to
evaluate the assumed normal density from Sobel's test.  The default is to
take 512 equally spaced points between the estimated indirect effect
\eqn{\pm}{+/-} three times the standard error according to Sobel's formula.}

\item{level}{numeric;  the confidence level of the confidence intervals
from Sobel's test.  The default is to include 95\% confidence intervals.
Note that this is not used for bootstrap tests, as those require to specify
the confidence level already in \code{\link{test_mediation}()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"setup_density_plot"} with the following
components:
\item{density}{a data frame containing the values of the indirect effect
where the density is estimated (column \code{ab}), and the estimated density
values (column \code{Density}).  In case of a model with multiple indirect
effects, there is a column \code{Effect} that indicates the different
indirect effects.  If a list of \code{"\link{test_mediation}"} objects has
been supplied, there is also a column \code{Method}, which takes the names
or indices of the list elements to indicate the different methods.}
\item{ci}{a data frame consisting of column \code{Estimate} containing the
point estimates, column \code{Lower} for the lower confidence limit, and
column \code{Upper} for the upper confidence limit.  In case of a model with
multiple indirect effects, there is a column \code{Effect} that indicates
the different indirect effects.  If a list of \code{"\link{test_mediation}"}
objects has been supplied, there is also a column \code{Method}, which takes
the names or indices of the list elements to indicate the different methods.}
\item{test}{a character string indicating whether the object contains
results from a bootstrap test (\code{"boot"}) or a Sobel test
(\code{"sobel"}), or a vector of such character strings if a list of
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} objects has been supplied.}
\item{level}{numeric; the confidence level used for the confidence intervals
of the indirect effect(s).}
\item{have_effects}{a logical indicating whether the mediation model
contains multiple indirect effects  If \code{TRUE}, the data frames in the
\code{density} and \code{ci} components contain a column \code{Effect}.}
\item{have_methods}{a logical indicating whether a list of
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} objects has been supplied.  If \code{TRUE},
the data frames in the \code{density} and \code{ci} components contain a
column \code{Method}.}

\description{
Extract the relevant information for a density plot of the indirect
effect(s) from results of (robust) mediation analysis.
}
\details{
This function is used internally by \code{\link{density_plot}()}.  It may
also be useful for users who want to produce a similar plot, but who want
more control over what information to display or how to display that
information.
