\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} containing results from
(robust) mediation analysis, or a list of such objects.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.}

\item{parm}{a character string specifying the effects to be included
in the plot.  The default is to include the direct and the indirect
effect(s).}

\item{type}{a character string specifying which point estiamates and
confidence intervals to plot: those based on the bootstrap distribution
(\code{"boot"}; the default), or those based on the original data
(\code{"data"}).  If \code{"boot"}, the confidence intervals of effects
other than the indirect effect(s) are computed using a normal approximation
(i.e., assuming a normal distribution of the corresponding effect with the
standard deviation computed from the bootstrap replicates).  If
\code{"data"}, the confidence intervals of effects other than the indirect
effect(s) are computed via statistical theory based on the original data
(e.g., based on a t-distribution the coefficients are estimated via
regression).  Note that this is only relevant for mediation analysis via a
bootstrap test, where the confidence interval of the indirect effect is
always computed via a percentile-based method due to the asymmetry of its
distribution.}

\item{p_value}{a logical indicating whether to include dot plots of the
p-values in addition to those with confidence intervals.  The default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{digits}{an integer determining how many digits to compute for
bootstrap p-values of the indirect effects (see \code{\link{p_value}()}).
The default is to compute 4 digits after the comma.  This is only relevant
if \code{p_value = TRUE}.}

\item{level}{numeric;  the confidence level of the confidence intervals
from Sobel's test.  The default is to include 95\% confidence intervals.
Note that this is not used for bootstrap tests, as those require to specify
the confidence level already in \code{\link{test_mediation}()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}"}.
}
\description{
Produce a dot plot with confidence intervals of selected effects from
(robust) mediation analysis.  In addition to confidence intervals, p-values
of the selected effects can be plotted as well.
}
\details{
Methods first call \code{\link{setup_ci_plot}()} to extract all necessary
information to produce the plot, then the \code{"setup_ci_plot"}
method is called to produce the plot.
