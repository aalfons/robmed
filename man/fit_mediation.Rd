\arguments{
\item{object}{the first argument will determine the method of the generic
function to be dispatched.  For the default method, this should be a data
frame containing the variables.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.  For the default
method, this can be used to specify tuning parameters directly instead
of via \code{control}.}

\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to
that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.  Hypothesized
mediator variables should be wrapped in a call to \code{\link{m}()} (see
examples), and any optional control variables should be wrapped in a call to
\code{\link{covariates}()}.}

\item{data}{for the \code{formula} method, a data frame containing the
variables.}

\item{x}{a character, integer or logical vector specifying the columns of
\code{object} containing the independent variables.}

\item{y}{a character string, an integer or a logical vector specifying the
column of \code{object} containing the dependent variable.}

\item{m}{a character, integer or logical vector specifying the columns of
\code{object} containing the hypothesized mediator variables.}

\item{covariates}{optional; a character, integer or logical vector
specifying the columns of \code{object} containing additional covariates to
be used as control variables.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method of
estimation.  Possible values are \code{"regression"} (the default)
to estimate the effects via regressions, or \code{"covariance"} to
estimate the effects via the covariance matrix.  Note that the effects are
always estimated via regressions if more than one independent variable or
hypothesized mediator is specified, or if control variables are supplied.}

\item{robust}{a logical indicating whether to robustly estimate the effects
(defaults to \code{TRUE}).  For estimation via regressions
(\code{method = "regression"}), this can also be a character string, with
\code{"MM"} specifying the MM-estimator of regression, and \code{"median"}
specifying median regression.}

\item{family}{a character string specifying the error distribution to be
used in maximum likelihood estimation of regression models.  Possible values
are \code{"gaussian"} for a normal distribution (the default),
\code{skewnormal} for a skew-normal distribution, \code{"student"} for
Student's t distribution, \code{"skewt"} for a skew-t distribution, or
\code{"select"} to select among these four distributions via BIC (see
\sQuote{Details}).  This is only relevant if \code{method = "regression"}
and \code{robust = FALSE}.}

\item{model}{a character string specifying the type of model in case of
multiple mediators.  Possible values are \code{"parallel"} (the default) for
the parallel multiple mediator model, or \code{"serial"} for the serial
multiple mediator model.  This is only relevant for models with multiple
hypothesized mediators, which are currently only implemented for estimation
via regressions (\code{method = "regression"}).}

\item{contrast}{a logical indicating whether to compute pairwise contrasts
of the indirect effects (defaults to \code{FALSE}).  This can also be a
character string, with \code{"estimates"} for computing the pairwise
differences of the indirect effects, and \code{"absolute"} for computing the
pairwise differences of the absolute values of the indirect effects.  This
is only relevant for models with multiple indirect effects, which are
currently only implemented for estimation via regressions
(\code{method = "regression"}).}

\item{fit_yx}{a logical indicating whether to fit the regression model
\code{y ~ x + covariates} to estimate the total effect (the default is
\code{TRUE}).  This is only relevant if \code{method = "regression"} and
\code{robust = FALSE}.}

\item{control}{a list of tuning parameters for the corresponding robust
method.  For robust regression (\code{method = "regression"}, and
\code{robust = TRUE} or \code{robust = "MM"}), a list of tuning
parameters for \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}()} as generated by
\code{\link{reg_control}()}.  For winsorized covariance matrix estimation
(\code{method = "covariance"} and \code{robust = TRUE}), a list of tuning
parameters for \code{\link{cov_Huber}()} as generated by
\code{\link{cov_control}()}.  No tuning parameters are necessary for median
regression (\code{method = "regression"} and \code{robust = "median"}).}

\description{
(Robustly) estimate the effects in a mediation model.
}
\details{
With \code{method = "regression"}, and \code{robust = TRUE} or
\code{robust = "MM"}, the effects are computed via the robust MM-estimator
of regression from \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}()}.  This is the default
behavior.

With \code{method = "regression"} and \code{robust = "median"}, the effects
are estimated via median regressions with \code{\link[quantreg]{rq}()}.
Unlike the robust MM-regressions above, median regressions are not robust
against outliers in the explanatory variables.

With \code{method = "regression"}, \code{robust = FALSE} and
\code{family = "select"}, the error distribution to be used in maximum
likelihood estimation of the regression models is selected via BIC.  The
following error distributions are included in the selection procedure: a
normal distribution, a skew-normal distribution, Student's t distribution,
and a skew-t distribution.  Note that the parameters of those distributions
are estimated as well.  The skew-normal and skew-t distributions thereby
use a centered parametrization such that the residuals are (approximately)
centered around 0.  Moreover, the skew-t distribution is only evaluated in
the selection procedure if both the skew-normal and Student's t distribution
yield an improvement in BIC over the normal distribution.  Otherwise the
estimation with a skew-t error distribution can be unstable.  Furthermore,
this saves a considerable amount of computation time in a bootstrap test,
as estimation with those error distributions is orders of magnitude slower
than any other estimation procedure in package \pkg{robmed}.

With \code{method = "covariance"} and \code{robust = TRUE}, the effects are
estimated based on a Huber M-estimator of location and scatter.  Note that
this covariance-based approach is less robust than the approach based on
robust MM-regressions described above.

The formula interface is still experimental and may change in future
versions.
