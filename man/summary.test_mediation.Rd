\title{Summary of results from (robust) mediation analysis}
\usage{
\method{summary}{boot_test_mediation}(object, type = c("boot", "data"), plot = TRUE, ...)

\method{summary}{sobel_test_mediation}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} containing results from (robust) mediation
analysis.}

\item{type}{a character string specifying how to summarize the effects
other than the indirect effect(s).  Possible values are \code{"boot"} (the
default) to compute significance tests using the normal approximation of the
bootstrap distribution (i.e., to assume a normal distribution of the
corresponding effect with the standard deviation computed from the bootstrap
replicates), or \code{"data"} to compute significance tests via
statistical theory based on the original data (e.g., t-tests if the
coefficients are estimated via regression).  Note that this is only relevant
for mediation analysis via a bootstrap test, where significance of the
indirect effect is always assessed via a percentile-based confidence
interval due to the asymmetry of its distribution.}

\item{plot}{a logical indicating whether to produce a diagnostic plot of
robust regression weights (see \code{\link{weight_plot}()}).  This is only
used for mediation analysis objects fitted with the robust MM-estimator (see
\code{\link{test_mediation}()}).}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments are currently ignored.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"summary_test_mediation"} with the
following components:
\item{object}{the \code{object} passed to the \code{summary} method, which
contains the results from testing the indirect effect.}
\item{summary}{an object containing all necessary information to summarize
the effects other than the indirect effect.}
}
\description{
Summarize results from (robust) mediation analysis for proper interpretation.
