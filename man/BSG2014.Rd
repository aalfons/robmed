\title{
Business simulation game data
}
\description{
The data were collected from 354 senior business administration students during
a business simulation game at a Western European University.

The game was played for a total of 12 rounds (i.e., two separate games of 6
rounds) as part of the capstone strategy class.  Students were randomly
assigned to teams of four, and surveyed in three waves: prior to, during, and
after the simulation game (with different variables being surveyed in the
different waves).

The 354 students formed 92 teams, and the responses of individual students were
aggregated to the team level.  Leaving out teams with less than 50 percent
response rate yields \eqn{n = 89} teams.  Only a small subset of the collected
variables are included here.

\usage{data("BSG2014")}
\format{
  A data frame with 89 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{

    \item{\code{ProcessConflict}}{Process conflict was measured with the three
    item scale of Jehn (1995) and responses were aggregated.}

    \item{\code{SharedExperience}}{Teams were randomly formed, no prior shared
    group experience is expected and shared group experience and training is
    developed during the first game for the second game.  Team performance in
    the first game, which was determined by objective performance measures, is
    a good proxy for the level of shared group experience and training.}

    \item{\code{TaskConflict}}{Task conflict was operationalized with the
    intra-group conflict scale of Jehn (1995).  Five items on the presence of
    conflict were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = none, 5 = a lot) and
    aggregated.}

    \item{\code{TeamCommitment}}{Team commitment was measured by four items
    based on Mowday, Steers & Porter (1979) and responses were aggregated.}

    \item{\code{TeamPerformance}}{Team performance in the second game was
    measured subjectively by the team members’ perceptions of the team’s
    functioning.  Hackman’s (1986) Likert scale items were thereby used to
    operationalize team performance.}

    \item{\code{TMS}}{Transactive memory systems (TMS) are defined as shared
    systems that people in relationships develop for encoding, storing, and
    retrieving information about different substantive domains.  TMS was
    operationalized with Lewis’ (2003) 15-item scale that measures the three
    sub-dimensions of TMS (credibility, specialization and coordination).  Team
    members responded on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
    agree).  Following Lewis (2003), the three sub dimensions were aggregated
    to form the TMS construct.}

    \item{\code{ValueDiversity}}{Value diversity was operationalized with the
    short version of Schwartz’s Value Survey (SVS) to measure team members’
    individual values (Lindeman & Verkasalo, 2005).  The responses were
    aggregated with the average of the coefficient of variations of each value
    dimension among team members.}
