\arguments{
\item{object}{the first argument will determine the method of the generic
function to be dispatched.  For the default method, this should be a data
frame containing the variables.  There is also a method for a mediation
model fit as returned by \code{\link{fit_mediation}()}.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.  For the bootstrap
tests, those can be used to specify arguments of \code{\link[boot]{boot}()},
for example for parallel computing.}

\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to
that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.  Hypothesized
mediator variables should be wrapped in a call to \code{\link{m}()} (see
examples), and any optional control variables should be wrapped in a call to
\code{\link{covariates}()}.}

\item{data}{for the \code{formula} method, a data frame containing the
variables.}

\item{test}{a character string specifying the test to be performed for
the indirect effects.  Possible values are \code{"boot"} (the default) for
the bootstrap, or \code{"sobel"} for Sobel's test.  Currently, Sobel's test
is not implemented for models with multiple indirect effects.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis
in the test for the indirect effects.  Possible values are \code{"twosided"}
(the default), \code{"less"} or \code{"greater"}.}

\item{R}{an integer giving the number of bootstrap replicates.  The default
is to use 5000 bootstrap replicates.}

\item{level}{numeric; the confidence level of the confidence interval in
the bootstrap test.  The default is to compute a 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{type}{a character string specifying the type of confidence interval
to be computed in the bootstrap test.  Possible values are \code{"bca"} (the
default) for the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap, or \code{"perc"}
for the percentile bootstrap.}

the standard error in Sobel's test.  Possible values are \code{"first"}
(the default) for a first-order approximation, and \code{"second"} for a
second-order approximation.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method of estimation for
the mediation model.  Possible values are \code{"regression"} (the default)
to estimate the effects via regressions, or \code{"covariance"} to estimate
the effects via the covariance matrix.  Note that the effects are
always estimated via regressions if more than one independent variable or
hypothesized mediator is specified, or if control variables are supplied.}

\item{robust}{a logical indicating whether to perform a robust test
(defaults to \code{TRUE}).  For estimation via regressions
(\code{method = "regression"}), this can also be a character string, with
\code{"MM"} specifying the MM-estimator of regression, and \code{"median"}
specifying median regression.}

\item{family}{a character string specifying the error distribution to be
used in maximum likelihood estimation of regression models.  Possible values
are \code{"gaussian"} for a normal distribution (the default),
\code{skewnormal} for a skew-normal distribution, \code{"student"} for
Student's t distribution, \code{"skewt"} for a skew-t distribution, or
\code{"select"} to select among these four distributions via BIC (see
\code{\link{fit_mediation}()} for details).  This is only relevant if
\code{method = "regression"} and \code{robust = FALSE}.}

differences of the indirect effects (such that it is tested whether two
indirect effects are equal), and \code{"absolute"} for computing the
pairwise differences of the absolute values of the indirect effects
(such that it is tested whether two indirect effects are equal in
magnitude).  This is only relevant for models with multiple indirect
effects, which are currently only implemented for estimation via
regressions (\code{method = "regression"}).  For models with multiple
independent variables of interest and multiple hypothesized mediators,
contrasts are only computed between indirect effects corresponding to
the same independent variable.}

\item{fit_yx}{a logical indicating whether to fit the regression model
\code{y ~ x + covariates} to estimate the total effect (the default is
\code{TRUE}).  This is only relevant if \code{method = "regression"} and
\code{robust = FALSE}.}

\item{control}{a list of tuning parameters for the corresponding robust
method.  For robust regression (\code{method = "regression"}, and
\code{robust = TRUE} or \code{robust = "MM"}), a list of tuning
parameters for \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}()} as generated by
\code{\link{reg_control}()}.  For winsorized covariance matrix estimation
(\code{method = "covariance"} and \code{robust = TRUE}), a list of tuning
parameters for \code{\link{cov_Huber}()} as generated by

specifying the columns of \code{object} containing additional covariates to
be used as control variables.}

multiple mediators.  Possible values are \code{"parallel"} (the default) for
the parallel multiple mediator model, or \code{"serial"} for the serial
multiple mediator model.  This is only relevant for models with multiple
hypothesized mediators, which are currently only implemented for estimation
via regressions (\code{method = "regression"}).}

\description{
Perform (robust) mediation analysis via a (fast-and-robust) bootstrap test
or Sobel's test.
}
\details{
With \code{method = "regression"}, and \code{robust = TRUE} or
\code{robust = "MM"}, the tests are based on robust regressions with the
MM-estimator from \code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}()}.  The bootstrap test is
thereby performed via the fast-and-robust bootstrap.  This is the default
behavior.

Note that the MM-estimator of regression implemented in
\code{\link[robustbase]{lmrob}()} can be seen as weighted least squares
estimator, where the weights are dependent on how much an observation is
deviating from the rest.  The trick for the fast-and-robust bootstrap is
that on each bootstrap sample, first a weighted least squares estimator
is computed (using those robustness weights from the original sample)
followed by a linear correction of the coefficients.  The purpose of this
correction is to account for the additional uncertainty of obtaining the
robustness weights.

With \code{method = "regression"} and \code{robust = "median"}, the tests
are based on median regressions with \code{\link[quantreg]{rq}()}.  Note
that the bootstrap test is performed via the standard bootstrap, as the
fast-and-robust bootstrap is not applicable.  Unlike the robust regressions
described above, median regressions are not robust against outliers in
the explanatory variables, and the standard bootstrap can suffer from
oversampling of outliers in the bootstrap samples.

With \code{method = "covariance"} and \code{robust = TRUE}, the
tests are based on a Huber M-estimator of location and scatter.  For the
bootstrap test, the M-estimates are used to first clean the data via a
transformation.  Then the standard bootstrap is performed with the cleaned
data.  Note that this covariance-based approach is less robust than the
approach based on robust regressions described above.  Furthermore, the
bootstrap does not account for the variability from cleaning the data.

\code{robmed()} is a wrapper function for performing robust mediation
analysis via regressions and the fast-and-robust bootstrap.
}
\note{
For the fast-and-robust bootstrap, the simpler correction of
Salibian-Barrera & Van Aelst (2008) is used rather than the originally
proposed correction of Salibian-Barrera & Zamar (2002).

The default method takes a data frame its first argument so that it can
easily be used with the pipe operator (\R's built-in \code{|>} or
\pkg{magrittr}'s \code{\%>\%}).
}
\section{Mediation models}{

The following mediation models are implemented.  In the regression equations
below, the \eqn{i_j} are intercepts and the \eqn{e_j} are random error terms.

\itemize{

  \item{\emph{Simple mediation model}: The mediatiom model in its simplest
  form is given by the equations
  \deqn{M = i_1 + aX + e_1,}
  \deqn{Y = i_2 + bM + cX + e_2,}
  \deqn{Y = i_3 + c'X + e_3,}
  where \eqn{Y} denotes the dependent variable, \eqn{X} the independent
  variable, and \eqn{M} the hypothesized mediator.  The main parameter of
  interest is the product of coefficients \eqn{ab}, called the indirect
  effect.  The coefficients \eqn{c} and \eqn{c'} are called the direct and
  total effect, respectively.}

  \item{\emph{Parallel multiple mediator model}: The simple mediation model
  can be extended with multiple mediators \eqn{M_1, \dots, M_k} in the
  following way:
  \deqn{M_1 = i_1 + a_1 X + e_1,}
  \deqn{\vdots}{\dots}
  \deqn{M_k = i_k + a_k X + e_k,}
  \deqn{Y = i_{k+1} + b_1 M_1 + \dots + b_k M_k + c X + e_{k+1},}
  \deqn{Y = i_{k+2} + c' X + e_{k+2}.}
  The main parameters of interest are the individual indirect effects
  \eqn{a_1 b_1, \dots, a_k b_k}.}

  \item{\emph{Serial multiple mediator model}: It differs from the parallel
  multiple mediator model in that it allows the hypothesized mediators
  \eqn{M_1, \dots, M_k} to influence each other in a sequential manner.
  It is given by the equations
  \deqn{M_1 = i_1 + a_1 X + e_1,}
  \deqn{M_2 = i_1 + d_{21} M_1 + a_2 X + e_2,}
  \deqn{\vdots}{\dots}
  \deqn{M_k = i_k + d_{k1} M_1 + \dots +  d_{k,k-1} M_{k-1} + a_k X + e_k,}
  \deqn{Y = i_{k+1} + b_1 M_1 + \dots + b_k M_k + c X + e_{k+1},}
  \deqn{Y = i_{k+2} + c' X + e_{k+2}.}
  The serial multiple mediator model quickly grows in complexity with
  increasing number of mediators due to the combinatorial increase in
  indirect paths through the mediators.  It is therefore only implemented
  for two and three mediators to maintain a focus on easily interpretable
  models.  For two serial mediators, the three indirect effects
  \eqn{a_1 b_1}, \eqn{a_2 b_2}, and \eqn{a_1 d_{21} b_2} are the main
  parameters of interest.  For three serial mediators, there are already
  seven indirect effects: \eqn{a_1 b_1}, \eqn{a_2 b_2}, \eqn{a_3 b_3},
  \eqn{a_1 d_{21} b_2}, \eqn{a_1 d_{31} b_3}, \eqn{a_2 d_{32} b_3}, and
  \eqn{a_1 d_{21} d_{32} b_3}.}

  \item{\emph{Multiple independent variables to be mediated}: The simple
  mediation model can also be extended by allowing multiple independent
  variables \eqn{X_1, \dots, X_l} instead of multiple mediators.  It is
  defined by the equations
  \deqn{M = i_1 + a_1 X_1 + \dots + a_l X_l + e_1,}
  \deqn{Y = i_2 + b M + c_1 X_1 + \dots + c_l X_l + e_2,}
  \deqn{Y = i_3 + c_1' X_1 + \dots + c_l' X_l + e_3.}
  The indirect effects \eqn{a_1 b, \dots, a_l b} are the main parameters of
  interest.  Note that an important special case of this model occurs when a
  categorical independent variable is represented by a group of dummy
  variables.}

  \item{\emph{Control variables}: To isolate the effects of the independent
  variables of interest from other factors, control variables can be added
  to all regression equations of a mediation model.  Note that that there is
  no intrinsic difference between independent variables of interest and
  control variables in terms of the model or its estimation.  The difference
  is purely conceptual in nature: for the control variables, the estimates
  of the direct and indirect paths are not of particular interest to the
  researcher.  Control variables can therefore be specified separately from
  the independent variables of interest.  Only for the latter, results for
  the indirect effects are included in the output.}

  \item{\emph{More complex models}: Some of the models described above can
  be combined, for instance parallel and serial multiple mediator models
  support multiple independent variables of interest.}
