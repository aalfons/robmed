\usage{
setup_ci_plot(object, ...)

\method{setup_ci_plot}{boot_test_mediation}(
  object,
  parm = NULL,
  type = c("boot", "data"),
  p_value = FALSE,
  digits = 4L,
  ...
)

\method{setup_ci_plot}{list}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} containing results from
(robust) mediation analysis, or a list of such objects.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed down.}

\item{parm}{a character string specifying the effects to be included
in the plot.  The default is to include the direct and the indirect
effect(s).}

\item{type}{a character string specifying which point estiamates and
confidence intervals to plot: those based on the bootstrap distribution
(\code{"boot"}; the default), or those based on the original data
(\code{"data"}).  If \code{"boot"}, the confidence intervals of effects
other than the indirect effect(s) are computed using a normal approximation
(i.e., assuming a normal distribution of the corresponding effect with the
standard deviation computed from the bootstrap replicates).  If
\code{"data"}, the confidence intervals of effects other than the indirect
effect(s) are computed via statistical theory based on the original data
(e.g., based on a t-distribution if the coefficients are estimated via
regression).  Note that this is only relevant for mediation analysis via a
bootstrap test, where the confidence interval of the indirect effect is
always computed via a percentile-based method due to the asymmetry of its
distribution.}

\item{p_value}{a logical indicating whether to include information on the
p-values in addition to the confidence intervals.  The default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{digits}{an integer determining how many digits to compute for
bootstrap p-values of the indirect effects (see \code{\link{p_value}()}).
The default is to compute 4 digits after the comma.  This is only relevant
if \code{p_value = TRUE}.}

\item{level}{numeric;  the confidence level of the confidence intervals
from Sobel's test.  The default is to include 95\% confidence intervals.
Note that this is not used for bootstrap tests, as those require to specify
the confidence level already in \code{\link{test_mediation}()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"setup_ci_plot"} with the following
components:
\item{ci}{a data frame consisting of column \code{Effect} indicating the
different effects, column \code{Estimate} containing the point estimates,
column \code{Lower} for the lower confidence limit, and column \code{Upper}
for the upper confidence limit.  If argument \code{p_value = TRUE}, there is
an additional column \code{Label} which gives the default facet label for
the confidence intervals. If a list of \code{"\link{test_mediation}"}
objects has been supplied, there is also a column \code{Method}, which takes
the names or indices of the list elements to indicate the different methods.}
\item{p_value}{a data frame consisting of column \code{Label} which gives
the default facet label for the p-values, column \code{Effect} indicating
the different effects, and column \code{Value} containing the p-values.  If
a list of \code{"\link{test_mediation}"} objects has been supplied, there is
also a column \code{Method}, which takes the names or indices of the list
elements to indicate the different methods.  This is only returned if
argument \code{p_value = TRUE}.}
\item{level}{numeric; the confidence level used for the confidence intervals
of the indirect effect(s).}
\item{have_methods}{a logical indicating whether a list of
\code{"\link{test_mediation}"} objects has been supplied.  If \code{TRUE},
the data frame in the \code{ci} component contains a column \code{Method}.}
}
\description{
Extract the relevant information for a dot plot with confidence intervals of
selected effects from (robust) mediation analysis.  Information on p-values
of the selected effects can be included in addition to confidence intervals.
}
\details{
This function is used internally by \code{\link{ci_plot}()}.  It may also
be useful for users who want to produce a similar plot, but who want more
control over what information to display or how to display that information.
