#' Business simulation game data
#'
#' @description
#' The data were collected from 354 senior business administration students
#' during a business simulation game at a Western European University.
#'
#' The game was played for a total of 12 rounds (i.e., two separate games of 6
#' rounds) as part of the capstone strategy class.  Students were randomly
#' assigned to teams of four, and surveyed in three waves: prior to the first
#' game, in between the two games, and after the second game (with different
#' variables being surveyed in the different waves).
#'
#' The 354 students formed 92 teams, and the responses of individual students
#' were aggregated to the team level.  Leaving out teams with less than 50
#' percent response rate yields \eqn{n = 89} teams.  Only a small subset of the
#' collected variables are included here.
#'
#' @usage
#' data("BSG2014")
#'
#' @format
#' A data frame with 89 observations on the following 13 variables.
#' \describe{
#'
#'   \item{\code{ProcessConflict}}{Process conflict was operationalized with
#'   the three-item scale of Jehn (1995) and responses were aggregated.
#'   Process conflict was measured in the second survey (between the two
#'   games).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{SharedExperience}}{Teams were randomly formed, no prior shared
#'   group experience is expected and shared group experience and training is
#'   developed during the first game for the second game.  The team's score on
#'   the first game, which is determined by objective performance measures, is
#'   used as a proxy for the level of shared group experience and training.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{TaskConflict}}{Task conflict was operationalized with the
#'   intra-group conflict scale of Jehn (1995).  Five items on the presence of
#'   conflict were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = none, 5 = a lot) and
#'   aggregated.  Task conflict was measured in the second survey (between the
#'   two games).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{TeamCommitment}}{Team commitment was measured by four items
#'   based on Mowday, Steers & Porter (1979) and responses were aggregated.
#'   Team commitment was measured in the third survey (after the second game).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{TeamPerformance}}{Team performance in the second game was
#'   measured subjectively by the team members’ perceptions of the team’s
#'   functioning, using aggregated responses to Hackman’s (1986) Likert scale
#'   items.  Subjective team performance was measured in the third survey
#'   (after the second game).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{TMS}}{Transactive memory systems (TMS) are defined as shared
#'   systems that people in relationships develop for encoding, storing, and
#'   retrieving information about different substantive domains.  TMS was
#'   operationalized with Lewis’ (2003) 15-item scale that measures the three
#'   sub-dimensions of TMS (credibility, specialization and coordination).
#'   Team members responded on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 =
#'   strongly agree).  Following Lewis (2003), the three sub dimensions were
#'   aggregated to form the TMS construct.  TMS was measured in the second
#'   survey (between the two games).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{ValueDiversity}}{Value diversity was operationalized with the
#'   short version of Schwartz’s Value Survey (SVS) to measure team members’
#'   individual values (Lindeman & Verkasalo, 2005).  The responses were
#'   aggregated with the average of the coefficient of variations of each value
#'   dimension among team members.  Value diversity was measured in the first
#'   survey (before the first game).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{ProceduralJustice}}{Procedural justice was measured by the
#'   intra-unit procedural justice climate items of Li & Cropanzano (2009).
#'   Respondents indicated the extent to which they agree or disagree with
#'   these items on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
#'   agree), and the items were aggregated to the team level.  Procedural
#'   justice was measured in the third survey (after the second game).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{InteractionalJustice}}{Interactional justice was measured by
#'   the intra-unit interactional justice climate items of Li & Cropanzano
#'   (2009).  Respondents indicated the extent to which they agree or disagree
#'   with these items on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 =
#'   strongly agree), and the items were aggregated to the team level.
#'   Interactional justice was measured in the third survey (after the second
#'   game).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{SharedLeadership}}{Shared leadership was measured following
#'   Carson, Tesluk & Marrone (2007). Every team member assessed each of their
#'   peers on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 5 = to a very great
#'   extent) on the question of \sQuote{To what degree does your team rely on
#'   this individual for leadership?}.  To operationalize shared leadership, we
#'   then summed all ratings of each other’s leadership and divide it by the
#'   total number of possible relationships among team members.  Shared
#'   leadership was measured in the second survey (between the two games).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{AgeDiversity}}{Following Harrison & Klein (2007), age
#'   diversity was operationalized with the coefficient of variation of the
#'   team members' ages.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{GenderDiversity}}{Gender diversity was measured with Blau's
#'   index, \eqn{1 - \sum_{i} p_{i}^{2}}{1 - the sum of the squared values of
#'   p_i}, where \eqn{p_{i}}{p_i} is the proportion of team members in the
#'   \eqn{i}{i}-th category (Blau, 1977).}
#'
#'   \item{\code{TeamScore}}{The team performance scores on the second game
#'   were computed at the end of the simulation through a mix of five objective
#'   performance measures: return on equity, earnings-per-share, stock price,
#'   credit rating, and image rating.  The scores are automatically computed by
#'   the simulation game software, and scores ranged from 49 to 110.  See
#'   Mathieu & Rapp (2009) for more information. The scores were communicated
#'   to the teams only after the third survey.}
